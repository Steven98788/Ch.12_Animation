All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
(0,0)

2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
They are the amount of pixels the ball will move up or down in a second

3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
dx * 60 will determine the amount

4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
dy * 60 will determine the amount

5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?

6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
make the ball bounce off the border.

7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
determine how fast the ball is moving

8.) What is the width of the window?
640 pixels.

9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
If the ball has hit the side of the screen

10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
if the ball hit the top or bottom of the screen
